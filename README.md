## Novatec Technology Radar
The Novatec Technology Radar is a tool helping us to visualize our idea of topics/technologies
lifecycle. We strongly advise interested users to also look at the technology radar
tools and idea of Throughtworks: https://www.thoughtworks.com/de/radar.\
Also, keep in mind that the Novatec Technology Radar is a way to present your own view
on the lifecycle of a topic/technology. Someone else might have a completely different
view. It depends on your usage and your business case(s).
### Rings
Rings are used to show the status in the lifecycle of a particular topic. In general,
topics go through the following lifecycle: observe, evaluate, build-up, work, reduce.
However, some topics may not make it to evaluate (if they are not interesting for you).
After topics have been in reduce for some time, they are thrown out.

#### Observe
In this ring you put all the topics that could be interesting to look at.

#### Evaluate
This ring contains all topics that are being evaluated.

#### Build-Up
If topics are evaluated to be continued, they will appear in this ring.

#### Work
Those topics are relevant in our daily life.

#### Reduce
Those topics were important to us in the past. However, we still are working
with them -- but to be honest: we'd like to get rid of them.
